hello! iâ€™m a post graduating (!) senior at IIT Kanpur studying quantitative finance and risk management. my research interests include quantum science, multimodal machine learning, protocols, frameworks and blockchain.

outside of school and research, i think about life, ramble about it sometimes, enjoy playing video games (mostly indie games and VALORANT), and watch a lot of anime, i do whitewater kayaking and some serious mma as well.
